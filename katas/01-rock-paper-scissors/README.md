# Rock Paper Scissors

![game screenshots](assets/iphone_5_screenshot.png =320x120)

The classical rock-papers-scissors game.

## Building the game

To build the game, run `npm run build`. This will build the javascript files
using the typescript transpiler. The `js` files will be found inside the
`typescript-output` directory.

## Running the tests

The game designated test runner is `jest`. To execute tests, run `npm test`.
If you want to enable watch mode, run `npm test -- --watch`.

## Requirements

The kata is completed if it passes the following minimum acceptance tests:

> It has a Player vs computer mode.

In this mode, the player can play the computer by himself. In essence, this
is the single player version of the game.

> It has a computer vs computer mode.

This is the spectator mode of the game. Here the player does not participate.
Instead, both player choices/movements/weapons are auto selected. You can see
their accumulated scores in the game and each round.

> In-memory game state management. As you play, you should be able to see basic game metrics. For example, number of victories (similar to KDA in other games). It's okay if they reset after reloading the app.

### Bonus Points

The following is a non-exhaustive list of tasks or indicators of a higher
quality implementation.

- **documentation**: build and usage instructions
- **feature**: nice user interface
- **feature**: additional nice-to-have game mechanics. Be creative!
- **tests**: not much to add.
- **documentation**: show the thought process inside the code in the form of
  internal documentation or comments. Which leads me to,
- **documentation**: of the public methods and functions of your code. One of the
  best ways to extend code--besides following the dependency inversion
  principle--is to have a great public-facing API. This allows anybody to
  grasp your code fast and even add plugins to it
- **meta**: any indication of uses of software design, such as design patterns. If
  you use a particular pattern, e.g. strategy; or an architectural principle,
  such as the open-closed principle of the SOLID principles.

## Programming muscles trained

This kata trains the following programming muscles:

- Polymorphism. The core of object oriented programming.
  - Useful to create new types without much trouble. Unlike data structures,
    polymorphism and objects are great to add additional types that implement
    existing functionality in a decoupled way. The holy grail of many
    programming projects. Since we have different weapons (rock, paper, and
    scissors), polymorphism _may_ be useful to implement the different aspects
    of weapons.
- Basic data structures. Such as maps and arrays.
- Functional programming higher-order functions.
- Depending on the implementation, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` can all be
  great assets while creating the game.

# RockPaperScissors

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
